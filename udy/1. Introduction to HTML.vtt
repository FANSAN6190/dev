00:01.350 --> 00:08.710
All right so now let's tackle what exactly is HVM mill and how do we use it to structure websites.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.260
So no matter what you use as your browser it could be chrome.

00:13.290 --> 00:16.350
It could be Safari or Firefox.

00:16.380 --> 00:24.330
They all have a single purpose and that's to interpret your files such as your HDMI files or CSSA files

00:24.330 --> 00:28.240
or javascript files into a Web site that should be displayed.

00:28.260 --> 00:34.440
So for example we've got a little bit of HVM l code here that says that our web site should have a title

00:34.440 --> 00:34.700
code.

00:34.710 --> 00:35.410
Hello.

00:35.610 --> 00:40.180
And in the body there should be a heading that says Hello world.

00:40.200 --> 00:48.240
So if we pass that code into our browser it will open it and display it like so with the title of the

00:48.240 --> 00:55.890
Web site usually on the top and that H-1 or that big Hedding showing up in the body of our website.

00:55.890 --> 01:02.580
So before we dive deep into this it's really important to remember that H Tim L is the foundation of

01:02.590 --> 01:03.780
all Web sites.

01:03.810 --> 01:10.890
So for example you won't see Web sites are created using just a CSSA file or just a javascript file

01:11.100 --> 01:15.260
but you can create Web sites using just an HMO file.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.510
Now it might not look great.

01:17.580 --> 01:23.970
It'll probably look like it came from the 90s but it does enable your website to display tags or various

01:23.970 --> 01:30.310
elements such as images or forms or tables depending on how you code up the T.M. file.

01:30.420 --> 01:37.320
So each channel stands for hypertext markup language and the really important part here is the word

01:37.410 --> 01:40.230
markup because there's many markup languages.

01:40.230 --> 01:47.400
For example you might have heard of things such as XML Extensible Markup Language or DML generalized

01:47.400 --> 01:51.850
markup language and all of these languages share a common history.

01:52.010 --> 01:59.130
They're based off some markup that used to be put into manuscripts where editors would mark up the manuscript

01:59.280 --> 02:05.190
and either specify changes to the author or specify structure and layout to the publishers.

02:05.190 --> 02:11.580
So for example you might have the squiggly line that shows the publishers that this part should be printed

02:11.640 --> 02:19.000
in bold or this part should be printed in a tallis and HMO works in much the same way.

02:19.140 --> 02:26.120
You can specify the layout and structure of your website by using HVM l tags.

02:26.370 --> 02:32.610
So if you head over to your browser and go to a Web site called Code Pennicott IO then we can have a

02:32.610 --> 02:38.370
look and have a play around with real life live DML so you don't have to sign up.

02:38.460 --> 02:45.600
Just head over to code Penda IO and then hit create new pen and then we're going to change the view

02:45.630 --> 02:47.560
to a format like this.

02:47.580 --> 02:53.000
So this is the live version of our website and these are the places where we're going to put our code.

02:53.130 --> 02:58.950
So as you can see code penned that you put in HCM LCS us and javascript which will together get interpreted

02:59.220 --> 03:01.680
and get shown on the left as your Web site.

03:01.680 --> 03:08.760
Now as we're only working with HDMI at the moment I'm going to minimize the CSSA and Javascript sections

03:09.150 --> 03:13.500
and I'm just going to work from the HD M-L section.

03:13.680 --> 03:20.430
Now we're going to need some text to work with or have something which we can give structure to.

03:20.430 --> 03:27.870
If you head over to Gutenburg to auxlang ebook slash 1 6 6 1 you get taken to the adventures of Sherlock

03:27.870 --> 03:29.870
Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.760
So one of my favorite books of all time.

03:32.940 --> 03:37.990
If you have a look down here you can see that you can view the book as plain text.

03:38.330 --> 03:42.750
All you can read this book on line as HMO.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.870
So this is what the plain text looks like.

03:45.870 --> 03:51.390
It has all of the text in the book but absolutely no structure.

03:51.660 --> 03:58.200
But when we have a look at the H.T. a mouse file you can see that it has laid out the book with a structure

03:58.500 --> 04:00.570
that is more human readable.

04:00.630 --> 04:04.030
And this is what we're going to replicate using HCM.

04:04.260 --> 04:10.620
So if you go ahead and just copy this part The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

04:10.830 --> 04:14.670
and you copy and and place it into your pen.

04:14.670 --> 04:22.530
So in the H.M.S. here now you can see that all of these tags gets put onto the screen with absolutely

04:22.530 --> 04:23.410
no structure.

04:23.610 --> 04:29.900
And in order for this to start looking like this we're going to start adding a little bit of HMO.

04:30.120 --> 04:37.590
So the first thing we can see is that this is the largest heading on the page so we can make our website

04:37.650 --> 04:38.460
look like that.

04:38.490 --> 04:47.010
Also by adding an H1 tag into our HMO so the tags start with angular brackets and end with angular brackets

04:47.040 --> 04:52.640
and in the middle is the type of element or the type of type you want to use.

04:52.680 --> 04:58.950
Now it's really important that when you open ties that also closed them because as you can see here

04:59.010 --> 05:00.510
I've got an open TYG.

05:00.700 --> 05:08.500
But I have yet to close it and it thinks that the entire contents of my page should be made into the

05:08.500 --> 05:11.440
largest heading possible and that's not what I want.

05:11.440 --> 05:15.840
I only wanted for this section the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

05:16.090 --> 05:19.450
So in order to close the tie it's the same angle brackets.

05:19.510 --> 05:23.070
But then I have to use a forward slash and then write H-1.

05:23.740 --> 05:30.180
So now only this part is an H1 or a large heading.

05:30.220 --> 05:36.280
Now if we have a look at the other parts I would say that this word buy is a little bit smaller than

05:36.280 --> 05:37.380
the author's name.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.540
So let's structure this as a heading or so.

05:40.630 --> 05:46.900
But let's make it a subtitle so let's make it a slightly smaller heading and to do that we can simply

05:46.900 --> 05:55.240
wrap this text around an H to tag it and now we have Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as a heading but in a smaller

05:55.240 --> 05:58.870
size and shown with less importance than the big title.

05:58.870 --> 06:02.350
So now finally we have this word by.

06:02.590 --> 06:10.900
And I reckon that's one size smaller than this heading so let's go ahead and wrap this inside an H 3.

06:11.620 --> 06:13.840
So I hope you're starting to get the gist.

06:14.050 --> 06:18.760
The heading tags get smaller as the number goes up.

06:18.760 --> 06:27.640
So for example if I changed this to an age 4 it gets even smaller h 5 smaller still and all the way

06:27.640 --> 06:34.000
until age 6 which is the smallest font size for the heading element.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.400
Now if you keep going to H 7 you'll notice that it doesn't do anything anymore.

06:40.510 --> 06:49.420
It doesn't change the heading size and that's because the heading elements only go from 8 1 to 8 6.

06:49.420 --> 06:51.220
Now how do I know that.

06:51.220 --> 06:52.480
I hear you ask.

06:52.480 --> 06:57.330
So this is a good point in the course to introduce documentation.

06:57.460 --> 07:04.270
And the reason why I'm talking about it so early on is because of how important it is to your journey

07:04.390 --> 07:06.110
as a web developer.

07:06.130 --> 07:12.280
So one of the key skills in becoming a great web developer or fact any sort of programmer is getting

07:12.280 --> 07:19.310
good at finding out how you can help yourself and a lot of that involves getting good at googling.

07:19.330 --> 07:24.730
How do you find the specific piece of information that's going to help you achieve what it is that you

07:24.730 --> 07:28.120
want or help you understand what it is that you want to know.

07:28.390 --> 07:36.340
So in this case we're talking about headings and we are using HMO and I'm going to add in the name of

07:36.340 --> 07:42.920
the documentation that I preferred to use which is EMDIN and it stands for the Mozilla developer network.

07:42.940 --> 07:46.090
So the same people who made Firefox for example.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.200
So if I go ahead and hit enter.

07:48.460 --> 07:50.630
You see a whole bunch of results come up.

07:50.630 --> 07:56.130
And the most relevant for us is the H-1 to age 6 and it talks about headings.

07:56.140 --> 08:02.110
So if we click on that you can learn more about the heading elements used in Tamil and they even have

08:02.110 --> 08:07.330
example code snippets that show you what it would look like rendered in a browser.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.530
Now there's a couple of sources for documentation.

08:10.630 --> 08:15.470
One is of course MT-NW Another one is called W3 schools.

08:15.580 --> 08:19.300
So let's see if we tried to have three schools with HDMI.

08:19.420 --> 08:21.650
And we're talking about headings right.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.090
See what we get here.

08:23.470 --> 08:26.970
So she M-L headings is the first result that comes up.

08:27.010 --> 08:32.680
And similarly you've got the code examples you've got the results and you've got a little bit of notes

08:32.830 --> 08:35.610
that tell you how you should be using your headings.

08:35.770 --> 08:42.990
So both of these places have a lot of really useful usage notes and it's worth reading through your

08:43.060 --> 08:45.460
first coming across a particular element.

08:45.520 --> 08:51.570
That way you'll have a good foundation of knowledge when you start to build and create your own websites.

08:51.580 --> 08:56.430
So I want to show you one last resource that I quite like using which is called Def docs.

08:56.470 --> 08:57.190
I know.

08:57.370 --> 09:03.100
And this is basic web site that puts together a lot of the useful documentation in a structure that

09:03.100 --> 09:05.320
I find to be quite handy.

09:05.350 --> 09:13.630
So if we have a look inside the HCM L5 tab and we go into the elements we can see that there's a total

09:13.630 --> 09:20.490
of 135 elements and if you scroll down you can see that we've got 8 1 through age 6.

09:20.530 --> 09:25.600
And if you click on any of these then it brings up actually the MDA and documentation so you can see

09:25.600 --> 09:31.600
that it's similar to what we saw on MDA but it's just structured in a very simple way and it's very

09:31.600 --> 09:32.600
easy to follow.

09:32.680 --> 09:35.240
So that's definitely a Web site that's worth bookmarking.

09:35.260 --> 09:41.380
So if we head back over to our age e-mail file We're going to change that back to an H-3 which is an

09:41.380 --> 09:46.280
age old tag that actually exists as opposed to something like h 9.

09:46.300 --> 09:52.150
So the next thing that we need to do in order to better replicate this Web site is to add some space

09:52.270 --> 09:54.160
between these lines.

09:54.220 --> 10:00.620
Now in a word processor such as Word or google docs you'll be able to simply just hit a few times or

10:00.620 --> 10:04.240
hit return a few times and get that speccing show up.

10:04.320 --> 10:09.050
Now unfortunately in HVM Well it doesn't quite work like that.

10:09.050 --> 10:13.290
It's a little bit more complicated in order to create that spacing.

10:13.310 --> 10:19.510
We actually have to use an 80 shemale element called a line break and it's written like so.

10:19.670 --> 10:27.280
And the interesting thing about this HDMI element is that it doesn't require both an open and a closed

10:27.280 --> 10:28.020
hug.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.190
So we have the H 1 3 2 h 6 tags.

10:31.310 --> 10:38.090
You can see that we started out by marking the text with an H1 and then we close it off with a closing

10:38.090 --> 10:45.530
tag but the line break element works all by itself and you can even put it inside like so to make this

10:45.530 --> 10:47.390
part go onto a new line.

10:47.390 --> 10:52.690
Now this is a good time point to review the anatomy of HTL tags.
